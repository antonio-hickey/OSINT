1281693955369787394 2020-07-10 16:57:06 -0400 <Latte_nomnom> I know people fantasizes asian females in a racist way. But then isn’t it also racist just automatically making a human being for a victim or trophy of sth bc she is a young asian female?

1281693949380431873 2020-07-10 16:57:04 -0400 <bijx204> I have no idea what those shows are 😂 but I definitely recommend Qing Yu Nian/Joy of Life. Li Qin's character was a bit more flat but the plot was just so good. Im sure she'll be better in season 2. I like how badass she is in The Song of Glory but I can't get over the plotholes

1281693948067512320 2020-07-10 16:57:04 -0400 <sparkybacon> Weird choice but 10 Cloverfield Lane. Such good tension that makes you guess if one of the characters is crazy or not. The ending was a little disappointing for me, because it answers your questions, but the for the rest you're just left in horrific awe and that's what was great.

1281693943500087297 2020-07-10 16:57:03 -0400 <MysterMetalGeek> That's literally pointless. Does covering chicken in gold add anything to the taste?  Nope, because gold just tastes metallic.  You don't add things to food for no reason. Every elements of a dish has a purpose.

1281693939964280834 2020-07-10 16:57:02 -0400 <SisNosi_Daily> There's something amazing with Pastor Chris' messages. Tonight I was so moved in my emotions in the area of wholeness. I started feeling sad, so I searched for a teaching from pastor on the topic of wholeness. As I watched it, God's presence just filled my heart. The word is life

1281693939465179142 2020-07-10 16:57:02 -0400 <FlugelOmega> Awesome Question I found: “How is ‘Cancel Culture’ Different to a Boycott?”  Cancel Culture at it’s worst is Terror, e.g. The Great Terror [Rev. France] . A boycott at its worst is just making people losing jobs.  In some contexts they are the same, but in other not so much.  https://twitter.com/rodrigo_alvarri/status/1281690311568367618 …

1281693937900687361 2020-07-10 16:57:02 -0400 <benjenkins4885> Don’t worry, we’ll wait. Just like we’ll be waiting on the wall to never be built and for Mexico to never pay a dime for it. Trump could sell idiots like you a great piece of oceanfront property in Arizona.
1281693937703489537 2020-07-10 16:57:02 -0400 <Supervg3> You wrote earlier it's not just the voice but the chemistry with the other actors. Were the other actors in the clip she did? If not then she proved nothing and it is indeed hypothetical.

Dishes in the sink equals just getting them out of the way. Unless the person returns later & loads them/washes them without prompting
